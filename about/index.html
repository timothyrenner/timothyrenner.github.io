                I'm a data scientist / software engineer obsessed with controversial, strange or hilarious data.
                Lately I've been pretty into maps.
                By day, I'm a machine learning engineer at HomeAway (opinions are my own).
                On nights and weekends when I'm not trying to keep my two kids alive I'm probably hacking on some project or fun dataset.

                Another fun fact about me is that I'm autistic.
                I choose to share this because I wasn't diagnosed until my 30s, and my life would have probably been a little easier if I'd been diagnosed sooner.
                My hope is that in being open about autism I can at least in some way help dispel the notion that autistic people can't be successful.
