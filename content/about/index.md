Machine learning engineer, data scientist, and data engineer. I enjoy making data work, whether that means collection, modeling, transformation, or deployment.

Sometimes "work" is really just pointless stuff.
I try to find ways to learn new skills by doing something dumb.

## Repos / Projects

Here's a sample of some dumb stuff I work on.

[**Spotify Smart Playlists**](https://github.com/timothyrenner/spotify-smart-playlists) - Automated workflows for making configuration driven Spotify playlists using DVC, DuckDB, and Github Actions. I told you this stuff was dumb.

[**Movies**](https://github.com/timothyrenner/movies-app) - Letterboxd clone (ish) with Go, SQLite, DVC and Obsidian for tracking the terrible movies I watch in my own database.

[**Movies Analysis**](https://github.com/timothyrenner/movies-analysis) - Full end-to-end DBT project built with DuckDB, using the SQLite database from the movies "app" as a source. Working on adding a Streamlit dashboard to it, eventually.

[**SVL**](https://github.com/timothyrenner/svl) - Haven't touched this one in a while, but I wanted to learn how to write compilers so I decided to make a SQL-esque language for data visualizations. It was fun but not terribly useful.

[**Kafka Streams Examples**](https://github.com/timothyrenner/kafka-streams-ex) - Really old repo where I taught myself Kafka Streams back when it was super new. Also includes a streaming pipeline inspired by an Onion article (seriously).

## Datasets
I maintain several pretty popular datasets on [data.world](https://data.world/timothyrenner).
You might notice a theme.


* üë£ &nbsp; [Bigfoot Sightings](https://data.world/timothyrenner/bfro-sightings-data) ([repo](https://github.com/timothyrenner/bfro_sightings_data))
* üõ∏ &nbsp; [UFO Sightings](https://data.world/timothyrenner/ufo-sightings) ([repo](https://github.com/timothyrenner/nuforc_sightings_data))
* üëª &nbsp; [Haunted Places](https://data.world/timothyrenner/haunted-places) ([repo](https://github.com/timothyrenner/shadowlands-haunted-places))
* üê∫ &nbsp; [Dogman Sightings](https://data.world/timothyrenner/dogman-sightings) ([repo](https://github.com/timothyrenner/nadp-sightings-data))

All of these were collected from publicly accessible data, either via file downloads or web scrapers of highly questionable code quality.
