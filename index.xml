I wrote this when Plotly Dash was brand new. Though the fundamental process and setup is the same, some of the details are quite a bit simpler now than they were when I wrote this.
In particular, the Dash Bootstrap Components library replaces the manually set CSS classes and works really well.</description></item><item><title>Finding Bigfoot with Dash, Part 2</title><link>https://www.timothyrenner.github.io/posts/bigfoot-with-dash-part-2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.timothyrenner.github.io/posts/bigfoot-with-dash-part-2/</guid><description>Building the plots necessary to find Bigfoot with Plotly&amp;rsquo;s Dash framework.
